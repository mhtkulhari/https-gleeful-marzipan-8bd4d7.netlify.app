<h1>Summary of CSK vs RCB match</h1>
<img src="cskvsrcb.jpg" alt="CSK vs RCB" style="width:50%">
<p>CSK won the toss and opted to ball first. There were two new young faces for them in replacement of injured Deepak Chahar and unavailable Chris Jordan.</p>
<p>In powerplay, partnership of Padikkal and Kohli helped RCB to score 78/0 in 6 overs. </p>
<p>Due to a great bowling spell by DJ Bravo, CSK managed to stop RCB at a score of 184/7.</p>
<p>In second innings, RCB bowlers showed brilliant performance but later on a fast fifty by MS Dhoni and some extra-ordinary shots by Jadega helped CSK to chase the target easily. </p>
